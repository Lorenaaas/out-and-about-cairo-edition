            <h2>Have an adventure!</h2>
            <hr>
            <p> Egypt in itself is an adventure, and where better to start an adventure than in Cairo. Mystical and fragrant, Cairo is a land of old and new, antiquities and progress. </p>
        </div>


        <div class="left-about-heading">
            <h2>Something old, something new</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Cairo is a mix of old and new architecture. You can easily get inspired and be part of this world by roaming through its old souks, meeting the people, and admire the lifestyle.</p>

        <div class="right-about-heading">
            <h2>Taste your way</h2>
            <hr>
            <p> There is no other way to put this: you need to taste Egyptian food! From the street food to the traditional dishes, Egyptian-Arab dishes are something out of this world! Filled with spices and colors, Egypt offers a variety of dishes to dillect even the pickiest of eaters. Meals can be meatless for vegetarians and vegans, but also filled with all sorts of meat and fish for the more 'hearty' palats.</p>

        <div class="right-about-heading">
            <h2>From the Nile to the desert</h2>
            <hr>
        <p>Cairo is set along the Nile river, and there is no way you can miss a ride on the feluca, admiring the city from within. Or from above! Going to have a visit on Cairo Tower gives you the perfect view of the Old Cairo, as well as the new one. Of course while visiting the pyramids of Giza you can find yourself immersed into the warm dunes of the Sahara desert. Makes you almost feel like Indiana Jones!</p>
